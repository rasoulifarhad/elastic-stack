### Global Ordinals

***Cardinality***
> 
> Cardinality refers to the uniqueness of values stored in a particular field.
>> High cardinality means that a field contains a large percentage of unique values.
>>
>> Low cardinality means that a field contains a lot of repeated values. 
>>

***Elasticsearch refresh interval***

> As documents are inserted into Elasticsearch, they are written into a buffer and then periodically flushed from that buffer into `segments`. This flush operation is known as a `refresh`, and newly inserted documents are only searchable after a refresh. By default refreshes occur every second, however the refresh interval is configurable.
> 

>  Elasticsearch merges small segments into larger segments, and those larger segments are merged into even larger segments, and so on. 
> 

> To support aggregations and other operations that require looking up field values on a per-document basis, Elasticsearch uses a data structure called [doc values](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/doc-values.html).
> 

> Term-based field types such as `keyword` store their doc values using an ordinal mapping for a more compact representation. This mapping works by assigning each term an incremental integer or ordinal based on its lexicographic order. The fieldâ€™s doc values store only the ordinals for each document instead of the original terms, with a separate lookup structure to convert between ordinals and terms.
> 

***Global ordinals***

>  Global ordinals is a data-structure that maintains an incremental numbering for each unique term for a given field. 
>> Global ordinals are computed on each shard.
>>

>> Terms aggregations will rely purely on those global ordinals to efficiently perform the aggregation at the shard level. 
>>

>> Global ordinals are then converted  to the real term for the final reduce phase, which combines results from different shards.
>>
 
>> If a shard is modified, then new global ordinals will need to be calculated for that shard.
>> 

Global ordinals work by precomputing unique terms into an ordinal mapping, which essentially are two tables.

> The first, assigns a numeric value to each unique term
> 
> The second assigns a numeric value, corresponding to the value assigned in the first table, to the document id of the term. 
> 

***Example***

> ***Create product index***
>> `PUT /products {"mappings":{"properties":{"brand":{"type":"keyword"}}}}`

> ***Inserting three doc intp the index***
>> `{"name":"Iphone","brand":"Apple"}`
>>
>> `{"name":"Macbook Pro","brand":"Apple"}`
>> 
>> `{"name":"Samsung Galaxy","brand":"Samsung"}`

> ***The first table created by the ordinal mapping assigns a numeric value to each unique term.***

>> | Ordinal |  Term   |
>> | --------| --------|
>> | 0       | Apple   |
>> | 1       | Samsung |
