### Global Ordinals

***Cardinality***
> 
> ***Cardinality refers to the uniqueness of values stored in a particular field.***
>> High cardinality means that a field contains a large percentage of unique values.
>>
>> ***Low cardinality means that a field contains a lot of repeated values.*** 
>>

***Elasticsearch refresh interval***

> As documents are inserted into Elasticsearch, they are written into a buffer and then periodically flushed from that buffer into `segments`. This flush operation is known as a `refresh`, and newly inserted documents are only searchable after a refresh. By default refreshes occur every second, however the refresh interval is configurable.
> 

>  ***Elasticsearch merges small segments into larger segments, and those larger segments are merged into even larger segments, and so on.*** 
> 

> To support aggregations and other operations that require looking up field values on a per-document basis, Elasticsearch uses a data structure called [doc values](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/doc-values.html).
> 

> ***Term-based field types such as `keyword` store their doc values using an ordinal mapping for a more compact representation. This mapping works by assigning each term an incremental integer or ordinal based on its lexicographic order. The fieldâ€™s doc values store only the ordinals for each document instead of the original terms, with a separate lookup structure to convert between ordinals and terms.***
> 

***Global ordinals***

>  Global ordinals is a data-structure that maintains an incremental numbering for each unique term for a given field. 
>> ***Global ordinals are computed on each shard.***
>>

>> Terms aggregations will rely purely on those global ordinals to efficiently perform the aggregation at the shard level. 
>>

>> ***Global ordinals are then converted  to the real term for the final reduce phase, which combines results from different shards.***
>>
 
>> If a shard is modified, then new global ordinals will need to be calculated for that shard.
>> 

***Global ordinals work by precomputing unique terms into an ordinal mapping, which essentially are two tables.***

> The first, assigns a numeric value to each unique term
> 
> ***The second assigns a numeric value, corresponding to the value assigned in the first table, to the document id of the term.*** 
> 

***Example***

> ***Create product index***
>> `PUT /products {"mappings":{"properties":{"brand":{"type":"keyword"}}}}`

> ***Inserting three doc intp the index***
>> `{"name":"Iphone","brand":"Apple"}`
>>
>> `{"name":"Macbook Pro","brand":"Apple"}`
>> 
>> `{"name":"Samsung Galaxy","brand":"Samsung"}`

> ***The first table created by the ordinal mapping assigns a numeric value to each unique term.***

>> | Ordinal |  Term   |
>> | --------| --------|
>> | 0       | Apple   |
>> | 1       | Samsung |
>> 

> ***The second table assigned the numeric value to the term in each document.***

>> | Doc     |  Ordinal |
>> | --------| ---------|
>> | N       | 0        |
>> | N + 1   | 0        |
>> | N + 2   | 1        |   
>> 

***Example***

Imagine that we have a billion documents, each of which has a `status` field. There are only three statuses: `status_pending`, `status_published`, `status_deleted`. If we were to hold the full string status in memory for every document, we would use 14 to 16 bytes per document, or about 15 GB. 

> ***Instead, we can identify the three unique strings, sort them, and number them: 0, 1, 2.*** 

>> | Ordinal  | Term            |  
>> | -------- | --------------  |  
>> | 0        | status_deleted  |   
>> | 1        | status_pending  |  
>> | 2        | status_published|  
>> |          |                 |   

> ***The original strings are stored only once in the ordinals list, and each document just uses the numbered ordinal to point to the value that it contains.*** 

>> Doc     | Ordinal  
>> --------|----------------  
>> 0       | 1  # pending  
>> 1       | 1  # pending  
>> 2       | 2  # published  
>> 3       | 0  # deleted  
>>  


> ***This reduces memory usage from 15 GB to less than 1 GB!***
